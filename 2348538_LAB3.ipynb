But as he navigated the medieval-style building to his dormitory, he noticed flashes of excitement in his neighbors' faces. He was joining a community of high-caliber students from across the globe. Suddenly, he felt a rush of elation.\n",

When asked what motivates you; he emphasized, , I don of each activity what's about is understanding that someone may have as the motivation I have that opportunity also let of me. There within one my key takeaways here. Never give up or think something only you; see things as I.\n",
